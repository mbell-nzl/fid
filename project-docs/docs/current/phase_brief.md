# Phase Brief - Phase 21

> Status: **Active / Task 12 STOPPED / Recovery Authorized (DEC-167)**
> Branch: `phase-21`
> Product implementation: **AUTHORIZED BY DEC-159 UNDER THE TASK PACK**

## Goal And Mode

Deliver one Heavy one-Issue operational walking skeleton: activated trust,
immutable Gate Registration, one Work Envelope/revision, one gate-evidence
Obligation, generic Actor/Claim/Run authority, fid-executed Receipt Evidence,
guarded transition, completion, resume, export, parity, and owned V1 removal.

**Operating mode: Heavy.** Authority, public JSON/Event contracts, destructive
schema convergence, local process execution, credentials/redaction, Artifact
safety, completion, and rebuild cross protected boundaries. One numeric phase,
two internal groups, one independent checkpoint; no 21A/21B exists.

## Binding Decisions

- DEC-152 as refined by DEC-158: Phase 20 retrospective controls task size,
  feasibility, report lint, review cadence, and checkpoint timing. DEC-153/154/155
  keep Gate D3.2 DP-1..DP-7, the exact slice/schema contract, and carry-forward.
- DEC-156: gate evidence guards terminal-success transition before completion;
  both use one shared Obligation evaluator.
- DEC-157: complete wire contract, kebab-case public enums, role-free bootstrap,
  exhaustive V1 disposition, achievable checkpoint, and tasks 19-22 order.
- DEC-158/159: QA refinements, four Human subchecks, three `<30 s` rebuild
  samples, Ready QA, and Human execution approval.
- DEC-160/161: role-free bootstrap stays exact with the task-2 nonpersistent V1
  bridge task 20 deletes; schema-v2 identity values are plain, task-prefixed.
- DEC-162: retained V1 tests are not protected contracts; the invalidating task
  converges them without weakening. Tasks 2, 8, 9, and 20 inherit the rule.
- DEC-163/164: QA `REPAIR` carries one ordered owner list, each owner repairs
  before fresh re-review; ordinary recovery names its TRG in `Source`.
- DEC-165/166: convergence follows the invalidating change and historical task
  labels never establish ownership; V1 behavior stays byte-identical.
- DEC-167: a required gate must exercise the scope its task owns; task 12 owns its
  `internal/dev` and `cmd/fid/integration/` convergence with per-row provenance. A
  directive-suppressed attempt does not consume recovery budget.
- DEC-168: 120s bounds each FEAS probe, 900s the FEAS set, 300s the tagged
  integration command; no budget bounds the QA Lead child session's lifetime. The
  Runner waits for the QA Lead and dispatches task 13 only on a verified PASS.
- DEC-169: the checkpoint returned REPAIR. Task 4 owns Activation same-key replay
  ordering across the whole family; task 9 owns the complete section-7
  category-to-exit mapping, not one code. Both gain `cmd/fid/integration/` scope
  and the tagged gate. Order: task 4, task 9, complete checkpoint rerun.

## Group 1 - Authority Foundation

| Task | Title | Depends on | VAL ownership |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0013 schema/constraints | approval only | 001 |
| 2 | Event v2, idempotency, role-free bootstrap | 1 | 003-008 |
| 3 | capability discovery | 1-2 | 009-010 |
| 4 | Activation trust | 2-3 | 011-015 |
| 5 | Gate Registration | 4 | 016-018 |
| 6 | Envelope values | 5 | 019-022 |
| 7 | generic authority | 4,6 | 023-024 |
| 8 | Issue Actor/Event convergence | 2,7 | 025-027 |
| 9 | retained attribution/judgment freeze | 7-8 | 028-031 |
| 10 | generic Claims | 6-7 | 032-034 |
| 11 | generic Runs | 10 | 035,037 |
| 12 | shared evaluator/nonterminal transition | 7,10-11 | 038-041 |

QA Reviews follow tasks 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, and 10-12; the independent checkpoint
owns VAL-042/043. Temporary replacement-bound V1 state may remain as
inventoried; PASS proves new generic paths do not consult it. Task 13 needs
checkpoint PASS and fresh Group 2 feasibility.

## Group 2 - Trusted Execution And Convergence

| Task | Title | Depends on | VAL ownership |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 13 | portable executor policy | checkpoint | 044-046 |
| 14 | live framing/redaction/controls | 13 | 036,047-050 |
| 15 | Attempt/Receipt | 13-14 | 051-054 |
| 16 | Artifacts | 15 | 055-057 |
| 17 | Evidence evaluation | 15-16 | 058-063 |
| 18 | terminal guard/completion/resume | 12,17 | 064-068 |
| 19 | export create/validate | 18 | 069-071 |
| 20 | V1 removal and migration 0014 | 1-19 | 002,074-075 |
| 21 | final-schema init/maintenance/rebuild/export parity | 20 | 076-083 |
| 22 | final interface/journey conformance | 21 | 072-073,084-086 |

QA Reviews follow tasks 13-15, 16-18, and 19-21. Final QA owns task 22
evidence and phase-end VAL-087. VAL-036 is the sole Human checklist assertion.

## Dispatch Controls

Before each next dispatch the Phase Runner runs
`project-docs/tools/report-lint.sh <committed-report> <task-spec>` and records
observed termination. Reviews are `qa/review-1.md`..`qa/review-7.md`; checkpoint
`qa/group-1-checkpoint-review.md`; final `qa/final-review.md` plus
`qa/human-checklist.md`. A task's required commands must exercise every file
scope it owns (DEC-167).

Every external schema-v2 `Originating task`, `Trigger signature`, `Attempt
count`, `Repair category`, and `Repair authority` value is a plain scalar, never
backtick-wrapped; each trigger begins with its exact originating task plus `:`.
Ordinary recovery names its TRG in `Source` without changing the exact-bound
`Repair authority`. A REVIEW `REPAIR` lists every Must-fix owner in the one
`Owning task` field in Repair Plan order, each repaired before the re-review.

## Journey Order

Mutate once: init/Issue; discover; activate; register; create/activate Envelope;
resolve Actor; Claim/Run; nonterminal transition; execute Gate; persist/link
Receipt; evaluate Evidence; terminal-success transition; finish/release;
complete; resume; export/validate. Delete the projection and rebuild, then
repeat only named reads, evaluation, completion state, resume, export, and
negative checks; never create a second Envelope revision.

## Dispatch Authorization

All four planning gates are complete: Heavy shape and Gate D3.2 accepted, plan
Ready at `e8a636e`, no unresolved refinement, Human execution approval under
DEC-159. Tasks 1-12 and review windows 1-4 are complete, `review-4b` PASS. The
Group 1 checkpoint ran complete under DEC-168 with VAL-042, VAL-043, and
FEAS-01..FEAS-19 all PASS, and returned `REPAIR` on two bounded findings. The run
is STOPPED after TRIAGE TRG-21-015 / ESC-21-011, exactly as DEC-168 item 10(a)
requires. DEC-169 supplies the owner routing and resolves it.

The Phase Runner appends, in order: `REVIEW infra-review-1` recording the
committed checkpoint (`Outcome: REPAIR`, `Owning task: task-4, task-9`);
`TRIAGE TRG-21-016`, the identity-only successor of TRG-21-015 that TL-Lite
allocates under DEC-169 retaining ESC-21-011, `Originating task: task-4`,
trigger signature
`task-4:checkpoint-repair:group-1-checkpoint-review.md:mf-1-activation-idempotent-replay`;
`STOP`; then `RUN-RESUME` with that trigger, attempt 2, resolution authority
`DEC-169`, continuing task `task-4`, and next recovery
`task-4 | qa-rework | task-scope | <that trigger> | 2`.

Task 4 repairs MF-1 first, then task 9 repairs MF-2 under an unbound
`TASK-RECOVERY task-9` authorized by the open review. Each returns its own
committed report and fresh two-argument report-lint. Then one fresh independent
reviewer repeats the complete unsplit checkpoint with all FEAS probes fresh and
appends the second review to the same artifact, recorded as `REVIEW
infra-review-1b` PASS. Task 13 dispatches only after that. DEC-169 item 8 holds
the exact field values.
