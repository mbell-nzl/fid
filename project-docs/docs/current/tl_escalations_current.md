# TL Escalations - Current

> Open items that exceed current repair authority and require full Tech Lead or

## Open Escalations

None.

## Latest Resolution

ESC-22-001 resolved on 2026-09-06 under DEC-190/191. Protected sequence
verification and canonical role configuration are repaired in
`3bb42b4efd391b216b752db2c31fe793f3538bac`; the real ledger accepted the
correcting triage and task-2 attempt-2 recovery through the canonical append
command. Resume that existing entry. Original escalation and resolution are
archived in `../phases/phase-22/tl-escalations.md`.

## Prior Phase Resolution

Phase 21 closed on 2026-09-04 (DEC-179) with every allocated escalation
resolved. All seventeen Phase 21 escalations and their resolutions are archived
in `../phases/phase-21/tl-escalations.md`; ESC-21-017 (DEC-177, missing accepted
Receipt read leaves) was the last one raised and closed.

Wrap-up note carried forward as a control weakness, not an open item:
ESC-21-007 through ESC-21-011 were allocated in the Phase 21 triage log and
resolved by DEC-165..DEC-169, but were never written into this register while
they were open. They are now archived from their governing decisions. Register
an escalation here at allocation time, not at resolution time.

## Protected Escalation Triggers

Escalate only for a required product, architecture, data-model,
public-interface, dependency, security/data-loss, specification, exhausted
recovery-budget, or unavailable external-capability decision. Ordinary red
tests, failed gates, report defects, QA rework, and incomplete in-scope work
remain bounded repair. Before claiming recovery exhaustion, confirm each
counted attempt returned a typed result and its directive permitted causal
repair. Externally interrupted attempts are session-liveness evidence, not
repair-capability evidence.
